// The Drop trait only has one method: drop, which is called automatically when an object goes out of scope
// - the main use of the Drop trait is to free the resources that the implementor instance owns.
// - Box, Vec, String, File, and Process are some examples of types that implement the Drop trait to free resources
// - the Drop trait can also be manually implemented for any custom data type.
